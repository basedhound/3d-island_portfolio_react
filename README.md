- **React** is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage application state.

- **Three.js** is a React binding to Three.js, enabling developers to integrate powerful 3D graphics and visualizations into React applications seamlessly.

- **Three/Drei** is a collection of useful helpers and abstractions for React Three.js applications. It provides components like effects, shaders, and pre-built 3D objects to simplify development.

- **Three/Fiber** optimizes the React binding for Three.js, utilizing React's reconciliation algorithm (Fiber) to efficiently manage and update the 3D scene graph.

- **Vite** is a modern build tool that prioritizes speed and efficiency for frontend development. It offers rapid server start-up, instant hot module replacement (HMR), and supports modern JavaScript features out of the box.

- **Tailwind** is a utility-first CSS framework that facilitates rapid UI development by applying pre-defined utility classes directly in HTML markup, eliminating the need for writing custom CSS.

- **EmailJS** is a service that simplifies email sending from client-side JavaScript applications. It provides APIs for integrating email functionality without backend setup, making it easier to manage email communication in frontend projects.
